# terraform-provider-ecloud

## Getting Started

To get started, the `terraform-provider-ecloud` binary (`.exe` extension if Windows) should be downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/ukfast/terraform-provider-ecloud/releases) and placed in a directory. For this example,
we'll place it at `/tmp/terraform-provider-ecloud`.

Next, we'll go ahead and create a new directory to hold our `terraform` file and state:

```console
mkdir /home/user/terraform
```

We'll then create an example terraform file `/home/user/terraform/test.tf`:

```console
cat <<EOF > /home/user/terraform/test.tf
provider "ecloud" {
  api_key = "abc"
}

resource "ecloud_virtualmachine" "vm-1" {
    cpu = 2
    ram = 2
    disk {
      capacity = 20
    }
    template = "CentOS 7 64-bit"
    name = "vm-1"
    environment = "Hybrid"
    solution_id = 123
}
EOF
```

We'll then need to initialise terraform with our provider (specifying `plugin-dir` as the path to where the provider was downloaded to earlier):

```console
terraform init -get-plugins=false -plugin-dir=/tmp/terraform-provider-ecloud
```

Finally, we can invoke `terraform apply` to apply our terraform configuration:

```console
terraform apply
```
